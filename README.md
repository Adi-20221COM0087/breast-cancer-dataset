The goal of this project is to implement and evaluate Support Vector Machines (SVM) for a binary classification problem using both linear and non-linear (RBF) kernels. The dataset is preprocessed through label encoding, feature selection, and standardization to ensure optimal performance. Two SVM models—one with a linear kernel and one with an RBF kernel—are trained and compared. Dimensionality reduction using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is applied to project the data into 2D for visualizing decision boundaries. Hyperparameter tuning is performed using GridSearchCV to identify the best values for C and gamma. The models are evaluated using cross-validation and classification metrics to assess accuracy and robustness. This project demonstrates the practical application of SVMs in real-world classification tasks.
